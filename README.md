# eShopV2

Proof of Concept for using microservices architecture and Domain Driven Design in context of Dynamics 365 CE application.

It uses simple Angular SPA which communicates with couple of services (Basket.API and Item.API). These service route the requests to the Dynamics 365 CE backend. Finally, the Basket.Managment project contains the Dynamics 365 CE plug-in logic.

The idea is loosely based on [.NET Microservices Sample Reference Application](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers) project.
